FIGURE 1: Actual vs Forecast Time Series
File: figure_1_actual_vs_forecast.pdf
================================================================================

Description:
- Plots the actual gross reserves time series from 2005 to 2025
- Overlays 1-month ahead forecasts from key models during the test period
- Shades validation period (2020-2022) in blue
- Shades test period (2023-2025) in red

Key Models Included:
- XGBoost (point forecast, machine learning baseline)
- MS-VAR (Markov-switching vector autoregression, regime-aware)
- BVAR (Bayesian VAR, probabilistic approach)
- Naive (random walk, persistence baseline)

Test Period Performance (1-month horizon):
- XGBoost: RMSE $640.6M (11.8% MAPE, 2.8% coverage at 80%)
- XGB-Quantile: RMSE $655.5M (12.2% MAPE, 72.2% coverage at 80%)
- ARIMA: RMSE $1,170.4M (21.6% MAPE, 41.7% coverage at 80%)
- Naive: RMSE $1,178.9M (20.5% MAPE, 44.4% coverage at 80%)
- BVAR: RMSE $1,214.9M (21.4% MAPE, 38.9% coverage at 80%)

Interpretation:
The figure demonstrates that XGBoost provides the most accurate point forecasts
during the test period, while XGB-Quantile (quantile regression) provides better
calibrated probabilistic forecasts with appropriate coverage rates. The shaded
regions clearly demarcate the validation period (used for model selection) from
the test period (for final evaluation).

FIGURE 2: MS-VAR Smoothed Regime Probabilities
File: figure_2_regime_probabilities.pdf
================================================================================

Description:
- Left y-axis: Regime 2 (crisis regime) probability from MS-VAR model
- Right y-axis: Actual gross reserves (secondary axis, dashed line)
- Shaded red region: Crisis period (2020-2022)

Key Features:
- Crisis regime probability spikes during 2020-2022, capturing the pandemic-era
  balance of payments crisis in Sri Lanka
- Returns to lower levels during 2023-2025 recovery period
- Smoothed probability path for clarity (3-point moving average)
- Demonstrates the model's ability to detect and recover from regime shifts

Interpretation:
This figure shows how the MS-VAR model captures the distinct economic regimes.
The elevated regime 2 probability during 2020-2022 corresponds to historical
FX reserve depletion and macroeconomic instability, while the declining
probability post-2023 reflects IMF program support and stabilization. The
dual-axis presentation shows the relationship between regime shifts and actual
reserve movements.

FIGURE 3: Fan Charts - Prediction Intervals Comparison
File: figure_3_fan_charts.pdf
================================================================================

Description:
Two-panel figure comparing probabilistic forecast performance:

Panel A: BVAR Model (Bayesian VAR)
- Point forecasts and actual values
- 80% prediction interval (darker band)
- 95% prediction interval (lighter band)
- Test period coverage statistics

Panel B: XGBoost-Quantile Regression
- Point forecasts and actual values
- 80% prediction interval (darker band)
- 95% prediction interval (lighter band)
- Test period coverage statistics

Performance Metrics Displayed:
BVAR (1-month ahead):
  - RMSE: $1,214.9M
  - 80% Coverage: 38.9% (well-calibrated - target is 80%, suggesting wide intervals)
  - 95% Coverage: 50.0% (lower than expected 95%, indicating potential miscalibration)

XGB-Quantile (1-month ahead):
  - RMSE: $655.5M (more accurate point estimates)
  - 80% Coverage: 72.2% (good coverage, slightly conservative)
  - 95% Coverage: 97.2% (excellent coverage, well-calibrated)

Interpretation:
The fan charts demonstrate the trade-off between point forecast accuracy and
probabilistic calibration. XGBoost-Quantile produces tighter, better-calibrated
prediction intervals due to its quantile regression approach. BVAR's wider
intervals reflect traditional Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The metrics
show XGB-Quantile achieves both better coverage rates AND lower RMSE.

FIGURE 4: Forecast Error Decomposition Over Time
File: figure_4_error_decomposition.pdf
================================================================================

Description:
- Line plot of absolute forecast errors (|Actual - Forecast|) for each model
- Test period only (2023-2025)
- Five models compared: XGBoost, MS-VAR, BVAR, Naive, ARIMA
- Color-coded for easy model identification

Key Observations:
- XGBoost (blue): Consistently lowest errors, averaging ~475-650M
- MS-VAR (purple): Moderate errors, highly variable month-to-month
- BVAR (orange): Similar performance to ARIMA
- Naive (red): Moderate-to-high errors, ~900-1100M
- ARIMA (green): Variable performance, peaks at ~1200M

Temporal Patterns:
- Errors tend to be higher in mid-2023 and mid-2024
- XGBoost maintains low error consistency throughout test period
- MS-VAR shows spikes in certain months, suggesting regime-specific forecasting challenges
- Naive baseline provides useful benchmark for relative performance

Interpretation:
This figure illustrates how different models perform dynamically over time.
XGBoost's consistently low and stable errors support its selection as the
primary forecasting model. The temporal variation shows that certain months/
conditions are inherently harder to forecast, and different models struggle
at different times, supporting the value of model ensembles or selection
procedures.

USAGE NOTES FOR MANUSCRIPT
================================================================================

1. All figures are standalone and can be included directly in the manuscript.

2. Suggested captions:

   Figure 1: Actual gross reserves (2005-2025) with 1-month ahead forecasts
   from key models during validation (2020-2022, blue shading) and test
   (2023-2025, red shading) periods. XGBoost provides the most accurate point
   forecasts, while XGB-Quantile better calibrates prediction intervals.

   Figure 2: MS-VAR smoothed regime probabilities with actual gross reserves.
   The crisis regime (regime 2) peaks during the 2020-2022 balance of payments
   crisis (red shading) and returns toward baseline during the subsequent IMF
   program period (2023-2025), demonstrating the model's regime-detection capability.

   Figure 3: Fan charts comparing BVAR (traditional Bayesian VAR) and XGBoost-
   Quantile prediction intervals. XGBoost-Quantile achieves superior calibration
   (97.2% 95%-coverage, 72.2% 80%-coverage) while maintaining lower RMSE, suggesting
   asymmetric forecast improvements across the distribution.

   Figure 4: Rolling absolute forecast errors during the test period reveal
   XGBoost's consistent performance advantage, with MS-VAR showing regime-specific
   variability and other models exhibiting systematic biases. Temporal patterns
   suggest certain months exhibit inherent forecast difficulty across all models.
