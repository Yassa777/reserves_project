\begin{tabular}{llcl}
\toprule
Variable Set & Key Variables & $k$ & Rationale \\
\midrule
Parsimonious & Reserves, trade balance, exchange rate & 3 & First-order BoP determinants \\
BoP & Reserves, exports, imports, remittances, tourism & 5 & Disaggregated current account \\
Monetary & Reserves, exchange rate, M2 & 3 & Capital flight channel \\
PCA & Reserves + 3 PCs from 8 indicators & 4 & Dimensionality reduction \\
Full & All available predictors & 7+ & Upper bound on information \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\noindent\footnotesize Notes:
$k$ = number of endogenous variables in the VAR system. The BoP set replaces the trade balance
with separate exports and imports to identify independent shocks. The PCA set extracts three
principal components from the eight indicators in the Monetary set, fitted on training data
only to avoid look-ahead bias.
