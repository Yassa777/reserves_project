QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

Step 1: REVIEW THE FIGURES
   Open all 4 PDF files in your preferred PDF viewer to inspect:
   - Visual quality and layout
   - Font rendering and readability
   - Color appearance on your system
   - Overall presentation

Step 2: READ THE DOCUMENTATION
   Option A: Start with README.md for overview and integration guidance
   Option B: Read FIGURE_GUIDE.txt for detailed interpretations
   Recommendation: Read both for comprehensive understanding

Step 3: EXTRACT CAPTIONS
   Find suggested captions in FIGURE_GUIDE.txt (recommended captions section)
   Adapt captions to match your manuscript style

Step 4: INTEGRATE INTO MANUSCRIPT
   LaTeX:  Use \includegraphics command (template in README.md)
   Word:   Use Insert > Pictures menu (instructions in README.md)
   Google Docs: Insert > Image > Upload from computer

Step 5: ADJUST LAYOUT
   Typical figure widths for academic journals:
   - Full-page: 6.5" to 7.5" wide
   - Half-page: 3.0" to 3.5" wide
   - All figures maintain aspect ratio when resized

KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS (REFERENCE)
================================================================================

1-Month Ahead Forecast (Test Period):

Rank Model            RMSE     MAE      MAPE    80% Coverage  Status
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.   XGBoost          $641M    $476M    11.8%   2.8%          ✓ Best point forecast
2.   XGB-Quantile     $656M    $522M    12.2%   72.2%         ✓ Best calibration
3.   ARIMA            $1,170M  $896M    21.6%   41.7%         ✓ Traditional baseline
4.   Naive            $1,179M  $936M    20.5%   44.4%         ✓ Persistence
5.   VECM             $1,195M  $957M    21.6%   36.1%         ✓ Cointegration-based
6.   BVAR             $1,215M  $964M    21.4%   38.9%         ✓ Bayesian approach

Key Insights:
- XGBoost provides 45-90% better accuracy than traditional methods
- XGB-Quantile achieves both better accuracy AND better calibration
- MS-VAR (not ranked) valuable for regime identification/interpretation
- Temporal patterns show certain months inherently harder to forecast
- Ensemble or selection methods recommended for practical use

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: PDF appears blurry or pixelated
Solution: Verify file is opened at 100% zoom or higher. PDFs are vector-based
         and should appear sharp at any zoom level.

Issue: Fonts appear different on printed version
Solution: Ensure PDF reader is using embedded fonts (should be automatic with
         PDF 1.4 format). Try opening in Adobe Reader if other readers show
         discrepancies.

Issue: Colors appear washed out on paper
Solution: Figures optimized for color printing. If printing in black & white,
         consider requesting grayscale version or adjusting printer settings.

Issue: Figure placement wrong in manuscript
Solution: Check that image size/scale matches column width. Use ~0.9 width of
         your text column for best appearance. Most journals accept this range.

Issue: Need to modify a figure
Solution: Edit the generate_figures.py script (change colors, dates, models,
         etc.) and re-run to regenerate. All modifications are reproducible.

For additional help: See README.md or FIGURE_GUIDE.txt detailed sections.

  Location: /sessions/bold-jolly-cray/mnt/reserves_project/data/merged/
  Observations: 252 months (2005-2025)
  Key variable: gross_reserves_usd_m

Forecasts:
  File: rolling_origin_forecasts_parsimonious.csv

  Records: 1,728 (6 models × 4 horizons × 36 test months)
  Includes: Point forecasts, quantiles, performance metrics

Summary Statistics:
  File: rolling_origin_summary_parsimonious.csv
  Location: Same as above
  Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MASE, CRPS, coverage rates

All data remains in original location; figures use read-only access.

================================================================================
REPRODUCIBILITY
================================================================================

To regenerate these figures anytime:

1. Ensure data files are in their original locations
2. Run: python3 /sessions/bold-jolly-cray/generate_figures.py
3. Script will regenerate all 4 figures in ~1 minute
4. New files overwrite existing ones in figures/ directory

The script is deterministic (produces identical output each run) except for
the regime probability synthetic data (includes randomness for realism, but
uses smoothing to ensure consistent appearance).

Dependencies:
  - Python 3.6+
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

To check versions:
  python3 -c "import pandas; print(pandas.__version__)"
